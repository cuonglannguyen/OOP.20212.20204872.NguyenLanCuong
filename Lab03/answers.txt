Quesions:If tou create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category.
Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No. JAVA does not allow us to do this. This technique is called "constructor overloading"
A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of parameters.
However, we cannot have two constructors with the same number of parameters and same types.
title and category have the same type "String" so it's not possible to do this.
