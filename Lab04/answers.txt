Quesions:If tou create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category.
Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No. JAVA does not allow us to do this. This technique is called "constructor overloading"
A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of parameters.
However, we cannot have two constructors with the same number of parameters and same types.
title and category have the same type "String" so it's not possible to do this.
Question in part 10.1:
I prefer using the latter version i.e the version when we can pass an arbitrary number of arguments.
Because the version of array parameter requires us to pass a parameter of type array into the method, while
the other version doesn't. We have more flexibility in passing parameters.
