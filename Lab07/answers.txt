Questions: 
1. Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT
In AWT, there are 3 containers, Window,Frame,Dialog
In Swing there are four top-level containers. They are JFrame, JApplet and JDialog,and JWindow
Each program using Swing must have atleast one top-level container, or else it won't work correctly. The most common is JFrame.
JWindow, Dialog,Frame are subclasses of Window.
JFrame,JDialog are subclasses of Frame,Dialog respectively.
2. Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing
Normally, the name of coresponding class in Swing is the name of it in AWT with the letter J at first.
3. Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications
The event handling mechanism used by Swing is the same as that used by the AWT.This approach is called the delegation event model.
